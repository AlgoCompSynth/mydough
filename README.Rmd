title: "mydough - read and write MIDI files from R"
output: github_document
---

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Motivation
Algorithmic composition requires the ability to read and write MIDI
files. While there are other R packages that read or write MIDI
files, they add other capabilities that might not be necessary,
like creating audio files or printable scores, read MIDI files but
don't write them, or require an external music engraving package
like "MuseScore" or "lilypond". `mydough` has a deliberately
narrow scope - just read and write MIDI files!

`mydough` interfaces to the Python `mido` MIDI library via
`reticulate`. `mydough` is completely independent of other Python
environments you may or may not have on your system. It installs
its own isolated `mambaforge` `mamba` / `conda` package management
system, its own `mamba` virtual environment, and its own copy of
`mido`.
