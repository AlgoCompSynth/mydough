## Why a score table?
The main output of algorithmic composition processes is a score of some kind. If
the composition is intended for human performers, the score would usually be some
mix of conventional music notation and specialized composition-dependent notations.
But for compositions intended to be rendeded by a computer or a collection of
electronic instruments, the most "standard" way of defining a composition is a
MIDI file. [@Back1999]
